* No,we cannot create objects of interface and abstract class

* We cannot create objects of an interface. To use an interface, other classes must implement it. Same as in C# Inheritance, we use : symbol to implement an interface.

* In C#, we cannot create objects of an abstract class. We use the abstract keyword to create an abstract class. For example,

// create an abstract class
abstract class Language {
  // fields and methods
}


// try to create an object Language
// throws an error
Language obj = new Language();
